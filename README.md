# calculator

this is the calculator I have been working on for a bit. i built it off git to see if i was understanding things correctly before pushing anything to git. created  html and styles to look like calculator and created functions to solve basic math operations.

2nd commit just added a display value to my calculator with explaination on how it works.

3rd commit added button functionality to calculator that prints class and value in console with my explaination on how it works.

4th commit got the keys working.

5th commit got the reset calculator button working, fixed decimal bug, and cleaned up event listners.

6th commit cal is finished
